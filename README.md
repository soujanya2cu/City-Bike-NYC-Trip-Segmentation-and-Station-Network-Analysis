# City-Bike-NYC-Trip-Segmentation-and-Station-Network-Analysis

## Project Goal


The project goal was to segment Citi Bike trips using daily weather information and trip characteristics, and provide business recommendations based on segmented clusters for potential improvements to bike redistribution and bike and station maintenance. After segmenting the trips, a network analysis can be performed within each segment to provide insight into which stations are most and least heavily utilized on distinct types of trip days. The thought process is that, if Citi Bike management knows, for example, tomorrow is going to be a warm sunny day, then they can predict which stations will encounter the most traffic, and potentially require additional redistribution of bikes. We predict that individual riding days will segment according to various weather patterns and system management can be planned accordingly.
